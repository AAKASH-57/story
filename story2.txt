1. The Boy Who Cried Wolf
There was once a shepherd boy who took care of sheep near his village. 
He was bored and decided to have some fun, so he shouted, 
“Wolf! Wolf!” The villagers came running to help him, only to find that there was no wolf. 
The boy laughed at them, and the villagers left angrily. 
The boy repeated this trick several times, 
each time enjoying the chaos he caused as the villagers rushed to his aid.

One day, a real wolf appeared, and the boy screamed in fear, 
“Wolf! Wolf!” But this time, no one believed him, 
thinking it was another false alarm. The wolf attacked the flock, and 
the boy learned a harsh lesson: 
when you lie repeatedly, no one believes you even when you are telling the truth.
