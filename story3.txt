TITLE: The Tortoise and the Hare

A boastful hare constantly mocked a slow-moving tortoise for being sluggish.
Tired of the hare's taunts, the tortoise challenged the hare to a race.
Amused, the hare agreed, confident that he would easily win. 
As the race began, the hare quickly dashed far ahead, leaving the tortoise behind. 
Feeling sure of his victory, the hare decided to take a nap mid-race.

Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving slowly but steadily without stopping. 
By the time the hare woke up, the tortoise was near the finish line. 
The hare sprinted with all his might, but it was too lateâ€”the tortoise crossed the finish line first. 
The tortoise taught the hare an important lesson: slow and steady wins the race.
